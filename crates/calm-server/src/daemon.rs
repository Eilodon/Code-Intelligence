//! forwarders against one shared `CalmServer` + one background indexer/
//! watcher/embedder, instead of today's default (one full `calm serve`
//! process per MCP client connection). Unix-only — the accept loop uses
//! `tokio::net::UnixListener`, which doesn't exist on non-Unix targets;
//! callers (`calm-cli`) gate `--listen`/`calm connect` behind `cfg(unix)`
//! and fall back to plain `calm serve` (stdio) everywhere else.
//!
//! v1 (shipped 2026-07-10, milestones M2-M5): idle-timeout after ~30min genuinely idle
//! (`IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL`/`IDLE_CHECKS_BEFORE_SHUTDOWN` below, gated on indexing/embed status too,
//! not just connection count) and version-handshake *enforcement* (`DaemonMeta::is_current`,
//! `try_connect_current` below — a stale build gets SIGTERMed and respawned, not just detected).
//! Opt-in only — `calm serve`'s default stdio behavior is completely unchanged by this module's
//! existence, and this daemon path isn't yet the default entry point for the npm/plugin
//! distribution (`scripts/mcp-launcher.sh` still execs plain `calm serve`).
