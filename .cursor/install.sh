# Cursor Cloud/Background Agent "install" step (.cursor/environment.json).
# Cached after the first run per Cursor's own docs, so this is the closest
# equivalent Cursor has to Claude Code on the web's Setup Script — see
# docs/cloud-environment-setup.md for the full writeup of the race this
# guards against: `.cursor/mcp.json` points at `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh`,
# which only builds the calm-cli binary inline as a last resort. Without
# this, the very first Background Agent session on this repo hits a cold
# `cargo build -p calm-cli` (~59s measured) that the MCP client's initial
# dial attempt can lose, marking the "calm" server failed for that session.
# Prebuilding here means the launcher's fast path (already-built
# target/release/calm) wins instead.
#
# UPDATE (2026-07-12): `mcp-launcher.sh`'s tier 1.5 now fetches a
# checksum-and-SHA-verified prebuilt binary from the rolling `edge` GitHub
# Release by default — no compile needed even on a completely fresh
# checkout with nothing cached yet. This script is kept as defense-in-depth
# (guarantees a warm `target/release/calm` before the very first dial, no
# network dependency at all), same as the Claude Code Setup Script — see
# docs/cloud-environment-setup.md — but is no longer the only thing
# standing between a fresh Background Agent and a failed first connection.
#
# Same defensive LFS-pull-before-build as the Claude Code Setup Script and
# `.claude/hooks/session-start-build-calm.sh` — a checkout without git-lfs
# leaves a ~130-byte pointer stub in place of the vendored embedding model
# (crates/calm-core/assets/potion-code-16m/); the build still "succeeds"
# either way (include_bytes! just bakes whatever is on disk in), so this is
# worth getting right before building, not after.

# Release, not debug: unlike the Claude Code hook (which targets

# `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh`'s fast path checks for first.
