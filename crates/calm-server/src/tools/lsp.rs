Upgrades ambiguous/textual call edges to formal by resolving each call site interactively against a live LSP session. USE WHEN: you need formal-tier call edges for rust/go/c/cpp immediately and the relevant LSP server (rust-analyzer/gopls/clangd) is available. Can be slow — spawns a persistent LSP server and does one round-trip per unresolved call site — not for routine/automatic use. NETWORK: none of these three spawn via npx, but once running they may indirectly trigger the underlying build tool (cargo/go) to fetch dependencies if the project's own cache is incomplete — inherited from the environment, not added by CALM.",
