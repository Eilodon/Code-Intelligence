# CALM — Coding Agent Liveness Map

**A live, graph-verified map of your codebase — so an AI coding agent can edit with its eyes open instead of grepping in the dark.**

> The CLI binary, MCP server name, crates, and packages are still named `ci` while this rename is staged incrementally — every command below works as written. See [`docs/rename-checklist.md`](docs/rename-checklist.md) for the full plan.

## The problem

An AI agent that edits code without knowing who calls the function it's about to change will, sooner or later:

- Delete "dead code" that a dozen other files still call.
- Change a signature and miss half its call sites.
- Refactor a symbol it assumed was minor — and discover, after breaking the build, that it was the hub the whole module leaned on.

None of that is a reasoning failure. It's a *visibility* failure: the agent never had a map. Give it one, and the guessing stops.

## Why "CALM"

Most coding agents operate the way anyone would in an unfamiliar codebase with only `grep`: no sense of what's wired to what, no way to know if touching this function ripples into fourteen others, no memory of the gotcha it worked out an hour ago. That's not confidence — it's fast guessing.

CALM stands for **Coding Agent Liveness Map**. *Liveness*, because the map is never a stale snapshot — it watches the filesystem, reindexes incrementally as files change, and is honest in every response about how fresh it currently is (`scanning → parsing → building_edges → ready`). *Map*, because it's an actual graph — call edges, import edges, hub/coreness metrics — not a flat text index pretending to be one. Hand an agent a live, trustworthy map of the terrain, and it stops flailing. It gets calm.

## An independent look at this problem — and where CALM sits

"Code intelligence for AI agents" is now a real product category, not a niche — several tools in it have tens of thousands of GitHub stars. A 2026 independent survey of that category landed on two blunt conclusions:

> "No tools [in this category] implement pre-edit safety gates or impact warnings before structural changes."
>
> "Memory integration [is] notably absent across all tools — a gap that remains."

Those are the two things CALM is built around: **hard safety gates before risky edits**, and **memory that survives a session restart**. Most tools in this space stop at "help the agent find code faster." CALM adds the step after that: help it know when to *stop and check* before it edits, and stop forcing it to re-derive navigational state (have I run `diff_impact` yet? am I going in circles?) every single turn.

Full comparison against Serena, CodeGraph, GitNexus, Sourcegraph/Cody, Cursor, and Aider — including a real tool-call benchmark, not just marketing copy — lives in [`docs/comparison.md`](docs/comparison.md) (Vietnamese). Short version: CALM trades language breadth (6 languages with a full call graph, vs. e.g. Serena's 40+ via LSP) for depth — confidence-graded edges, hard pre-edit gates, and durable memory that the broader-coverage tools generally don't have.

## Philosophy

CALM isn't a pile of MCP tools bolted together — it's designed as a **map and an active co-pilot for the agent actually holding the wheel**, not a dashboard for a human watching from the sidelines.

- **Every response carries `suggested_next`.** The agent is rarely left guessing what step comes next — the tool that just ran tells it.
- **The genuinely risky steps are hard-gated, not just recommended.** `edit_context` before any edit, `diff_impact` before any commit — these are enforced, not suggested. Everything lower-stakes just nudges; the agent keeps its own judgment where the cost of being wrong is low.
- **The signals are proactive, not something the agent has to ask for.** `fitness_report`, `session_context`'s `pending_diff_impact` / `possibly_stuck`, `repo_overview`'s `memory_notes_count` — the agent never has to remember "did I already check impact?" or notice on its own "am I going in circles?". CALM answers before it's asked.

The end goal is reduced cognitive load: the agent spends its budget on the work that actually creates value, not on managing its own navigational bookkeeping.

## Proof, not promises

Numbers are cheap to claim and easy to fake. These are measured, today, by running CALM on its own ~1,350-symbol Rust codebase — not aspirational:

| Metric | Measured value |
|---|---|
| Call edges resolved to `formal` (rust-analyzer ground truth) | **1,619 / 2,096 — 77.2%**, up from 0% before the SCIP overlay was wired in |
| Self dead-code rate (`dead_code_pct`, coverage-aware) | **0.71%** |
| Hub concentration (`hub_pct`) | 11.5% (well under the 20% gate) |
| Full test suite (default features) | **574 passed, 0 failed** — reconfirmed 0 failures in 2 more feature-flag combinations (bare minimum, and SCIP overlay explicitly off) |
| Architecture boundary violations | 0 (declared rules actively enforced, not aspirational) |

That SCIP-overlay number is the one worth pausing on: CALM doesn't just guess at Rust call graphs from syntax — when `rust-analyzer` is on the machine, it silently upgrades the graph to type-checked ground truth, with a hard 120-second timeout and result caching so it never becomes the slow part of your day.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the binary
cargo build --release -p ci-cli

# 2. Initialize config for your project
ci init --project-root .

# 3. Build the index (embeds symbols too, if semantic search is enabled in config.json)
ci index --project-root .

# 4. Run the MCP server over stdio — incremental reindex kicks in automatically if an index already exists
ci serve --project-root .
```

This repo ships ready-made config for Claude Code (`.mcp.json`), Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`), and VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`) — all three point at `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh`, a shared launcher that finds an already-built binary, downloads a checksum-verified prebuilt release if you're on a matching git tag, or builds from source if nothing is available yet. Clone the repo and it just works — no manual build step required first. See [`docs/mcp-client-setup.md`](docs/mcp-client-setup.md) (Vietnamese) for Windsurf/JetBrains (global config, can't be checked into a repo) and how the launcher decides what to do.

Don't want to clone this repo? See [`docs/mcp-client-setup.md`](docs/mcp-client-setup.md) — install via `curl | sh` (`scripts/install.sh`) or `npx @eilodon/ci-mcp`, then run `ci setup` from inside your own project to write MCP config pointing at the binary you just installed.

> **Note:** `ci serve` automatically adds `.codeindex/` to `.gitignore` on startup so the index database never gets committed.

## Example: an agent's actual workflow

```
agent: repo_overview()
  → 88 files, 1,346 symbols, 130 hub symbols, indexing_phase=ready

agent: "I need to change getUserByEmail"
  → locate("getUserByEmail")        # find the file + symbol metadata
  → source("getUserByEmail")        # read just the function body, not the whole file
  → edit_context("getUserByEmail")  # MANDATORY before any edit
      → 12 callers, risk_assessment=high → agent reviews each caller before touching the signature
  → edit_symbol("getUserByEmail", expected_hash=..., new_text=...)
      → risk_assessment=high, is_hub=true, no confirm:true → refused, with an explanation
  → edit_symbol(..., confirm=true)  # confirms the review is done — writes for real, reindexes immediately
  → diff_impact(staged=true)        # verifies blast radius before commit
```

## How CALM works

### Multi-tier indexing
- **6 Tier-0 languages** — Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go — get full `tree-sitter` AST parsing, a real call graph, an import graph, and multi-tier resolution.
- **8 Tier-0.5 languages** — C, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Swift, Shell — get regex/line-scan symbol extraction (no call graph or import resolution). Built in, no feature flag required.
- **Incremental watcher** — only changed files get re-parsed (FNV-1a content hash diff); the call graph rebuilds incrementally, parallelized with `rayon`. `ci serve` picks incremental reindex automatically whenever an index already exists.

### A call graph you can actually trust
- **Every edge carries a confidence label** — `resolved` / `inferred` / `formal` / `textual` (plus `ambiguous`/`unresolved` fallback tiers when a call site's target genuinely can't be pinned down) — so an agent knows when it's looking at a sure thing versus a best guess.
- **SCIP overlay (rust-analyzer) for ground truth on Rust** — on by default. Auto-detects `rust-analyzer` on `PATH`/rustup/VS Code and silently does nothing if it isn't there (zero behavior change on a machine without Rust tooling). A hard 120-second timeout kills and falls back to the syntactic graph if it ever runs long; results are cached against `(rust-analyzer version, Cargo.lock hash, changed files)` so it doesn't re-run on every reindex.
- **Graph metrics — `coreness` (k-core) and `is_hub`** — flag the symbols central enough that touching them is inherently higher-risk. `repo_overview.core_symbols` reuses the same metric to sketch the architecture's "skeleton" on the very first call (inspired by Aider's PageRank repo-map, but built on a metric CALM already computes rather than a separate pass).

### Search that actually finds things
- **Full-text + semantic search, fused** — FTS5 (BM25) combined with semantic embeddings (`model2vec-rs`, pure Rust, no ONNX) via a 3-way Reciprocal Rank Fusion (text + symbol-identity vector + code-body-chunk vector) — finds relevant code even when the query doesn't share a token with the symbol name. KNN is a brute-force cosine scan in pure Rust with an in-RAM cache — no C vector-search extension, so it behaves identically on every release platform (the previous `sqlite-vec` dependency didn't compile on musl libc, which silently killed semantic search on Linux/Docker builds). The default model (`minishlab/potion-code-16M`, MIT-licensed) is vendored straight into the binary at compile time via Git LFS — no network needed for the default case; a broken LFS checkout falls back to downloading it once from Hugging Face and caching it locally, unless you explicitly opt out to keep a strict zero-network guarantee.
- **Real grep/glob, straight off disk** — `search(kind="grep")` uses actual regex + glob filtering through a `.gitignore`-respecting walker, bypassing the index entirely — so it reaches files the indexer never parses (`Cargo.toml`, `docs/*.md`) too, each match enriched with its surrounding symbol when one exists.
- **Noise-penalty ranking** — results living in test/generated/example files are scored down when an equivalent real-implementation result exists, so the actual code surfaces first instead of getting buried under a same-named test fixture.

### Editing with an actual safety net
- **`edit_lines`/`edit_symbol`** — the one write path, working on any tracked file (not just parsed symbols). A content-hash conflict guard (FNV-1a) on the exact line range rejects stale writes and hands back the current hash/content to re-read; multiple hunks in one call apply bottom-up so offsets never drift between them.
- **Syntax-validated before it ever touches disk** — `tree-sitter` checks the result parses cleanly; a write that would introduce a syntax error is refused outright, nothing gets written.
- **Hub and high-fan-in symbols require an explicit `confirm:true`** — a policy only a tool with a real call graph can enforce.
- **Atomic writes, immediate reindex** — temp file + fsync + rename, then reindexed synchronously (not waiting on the file watcher); the response comes back with post-edit risk/callers, like a miniature `diff_impact`.
- **Hook-enforced, not just documented** — under Claude Code, `.claude/hooks/ci-nudge.sh` actually blocks the first `Edit` of a session until `edit_context` has been called, and blocks `git commit`/`git push` if files changed since the last `diff_impact`. `session_context`'s `pending_diff_impact` gives the same signal on any other MCP client.

### The codebase grading itself
- **`ci fitness-check` / `fitness_report`** — 9 metrics (hub concentration, dead code, hotspot risk, edge coverage, cyclomatic complexity, architecture-boundary violations, doc-drift) checked against thresholds in `thresholds.toml`, queryable mid-session or as a CI gate.
- **Coverage-aware dead-code detection** — auto-detects lcov / `.coverage` / Go `coverage.out` / Cobertura XML at startup and folds real runtime coverage into `dead_code_confidence`, so code a test actually exercises at runtime doesn't get flagged just because the static call graph missed the call site. `scripts/gen-coverage.sh` generates one on demand for this repo itself.
- **Architecture boundaries — `[[boundaries]]`** — declare "module A must not import module B" directly in `thresholds.toml`, matched by path prefix against the real import graph; every violation is reported with the actual offending file pair, not just a count.
- **Doc-drift detection — `[config_drift]`** — flags file-path references inside declared docs that no longer point at anything real, so a design doc doesn't quietly keep describing a file that was deleted three refactors ago.

### An agent that remembers, and knows when it's stuck
- **`remember`/`recall`** — durable, interpretive notes (an architecture decision, a gotcha) keyed by topic, surviving restarts — distinct from `session_context`, which only tracks in-session navigation and resets on restart.
- **Git co-change mining** — `edit_context` mines `git log` for files that historically change alongside the one being edited despite no import/call relationship (a model and its migration, say) — a coupling signal the static graph can't see on its own.
- **Session progress signal** — `session_context.possibly_stuck` flags 10+ tool calls with no new file/symbol touched; informational only, the decision to break the loop stays with the host (e.g. Claude Code's `/goal`).
- **MCP Prompts** — `review_symbol`, `debug_symbol`, `onboard_area` package a full multi-step workflow into one slash-command-style call.

### Honest about its own freshness
- **Index state machine surfaced everywhere** — `scanning → parsing → building_edges → ready`, so an agent never mistakes stale data for current.
- **Build-freshness check** — `ci doctor` compares the commit the running binary was built from against the repo's current `HEAD`; `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh` checks source mtimes before trusting an existing `target/{debug,release}/ci`, rebuilding rather than silently serving a stale binary.
- **Single-instance indexing lock** — only one `ci serve` process per project root ever runs the background indexer/watcher (an OS-level advisory lock); a second concurrent process (e.g. two editor sessions on the same repo) serves tool calls read-only against the same fresh DB instead of racing a redundant reindex against it.

### Safe by default
- **Output sanitization** — `source`/`understand` redact credential-shaped text (PEM keys, GitHub/AWS/Slack tokens, JWTs, password assignments) before it's ever returned, and flag a `content_warning` when code contains prompt-injection-shaped text (`"ignore previous instructions"`, fake `system:` markers) — flagged, never silently altered, since a false positive there would corrupt real code.
- **Local-only** — no outbound calls for the code/data path. The one narrow exception is the semantic-search default model download, which is a single public, static file fetch, opt-out-able, and unrelated to your repo's contents ever leaving the machine.

## Crate layout

- `crates/ci-core/` — the index engine: `tree-sitter` parsing, SQLite schema, the multi-tier resolver (conservative → inferred → formal/Stack-Graphs or SCIP), graph algorithms (coreness, hub detection), FTS5/semantic search, analysis (hotspots, coverage, codeowners, diff-impact, dead-code), fitness metrics, gitignore management.
- `crates/ci-server/` — the MCP server (`rmcp` over stdio), exposing 21 tools plus the incremental file watcher.
- `crates/ci-cli/` — the CLI: `ci init`, `ci index`, `ci serve`, `ci setup`, `ci fitness-check`, `ci doctor`.

## CLI reference

## 21 MCP tools for AI agents

CLI presets filter tools by workflow phase: `orient`, `trace`, `edit`, `compound`, `full` (default) via `ci serve --preset` or the `preset` field in `config.json`. Every response carries `suggested_next` to point at the next step — full detail on each tool and the complete workflow lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

| Group | Tools |
|---|---|
| Orient | `repo_overview`, `hotspots`, `fitness_report` (health snapshot — same metrics as `ci fitness-check`, queryable mid-session), `indexing_status` |
| Locate | `locate`, `search`, `file_overview` |
| Inspect | `source`, `symbol_info`, `understand` |
| Trace | `callers`, `callees`, `path`, `dependencies` |
| Edit | `edit_context` (mandatory before any edit), `edit_lines`/`edit_symbol` (the one write tool — hash-verified, risk-gated), `diff_impact` (mandatory before commit) — the first and last are hook-enforced under Claude Code (see `.claude/hooks/ci-nudge.sh`); `session_context`'s `pending_diff_impact` is the equivalent signal on any other MCP client |
| Recover | `session_context`, `remember`, `recall` |

### MCP Prompts — workflows packaged as slash-commands

Distinct from the `tools` above — MCP Prompts (`prompts/list`, `prompts/get`) return a single ready-made instruction message for a workflow you repeat often; MCP clients surface them as slash-commands:

| Prompt | Argument | Packaged workflow |
|---|---|---|
| `review_symbol` | `symbol` | `locate` → `source` → `edit_context` (mandatory) → risk summary before touching anything |
| `debug_symbol` | `symbol` | `understand` → `callers(max_depth=3)` → check `test_files`/`dead_code_confidence` |
| `onboard_area` | `path` | `repo_overview` → `file_overview`/`dependencies` → `hotspots` scoped to that path |

## Fitness check — the CI gate

`ci fitness-check` measures 9 metrics against thresholds declared in `thresholds.toml`:

| Metric | What it measures | Default threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `hub_count` | Count of symbols classified as hubs | ≤ 1000 |
| `hub_pct` | % of symbols that are hubs (scale-invariant) | ≤ 20.0% |
| `avg_coreness` | Average k-core coreness across the graph | ≤ 15.0 |
| `dead_code_pct` | % of symbols with "high" dead-code confidence | ≤ 10% |
| `hotspot_risk` | Highest hotspot score in the codebase | ≤ 0.75 |
| `edge_coverage_pct` | % of symbols with at least one call edge | ≥ 60% |
| `high_complexity_pct` | % of functions/methods with McCabe cyclomatic complexity > 10 (AST-based; Tier-0.5 languages always report complexity 1) | ≤ 15.0% |
| `boundary_violations` | Count of `import_edges` violating a declared `[[boundaries]]` rule | ≤ 0 |
| `config_drift_count` | Count of doc file-path references (declared via `[config_drift].doc_paths`) pointing at nothing real | ≤ 0 |

Every `ci fitness-check` run also snapshots metrics to the DB so `edit_context` can show a trend (delta versus the previous day).

### Architecture boundaries — `[[boundaries]]`

Declare "module A must not import module B" directly in `thresholds.toml` (same file as `[thresholds]`), matched by path prefix (not glob/regex). Note this is for layering Rust's own crate/module boundaries *don't* already enforce — declaring "ci-core must not import ci-server" would be a no-op, since Cargo's dependency graph makes that structurally impossible already:

```toml
[[boundaries]]
from = "crates/ci-core/src/indexer/"
to = "crates/ci-core/src/analysis/"
reason = "indexer (extraction) must stay upstream of analysis (dead-code, hotspots, fitness) — not the other way around"
```

`ci fitness-check` reports each violation concretely (the real from/to path, the rule, and the reason) outside `--json` mode; the default `max_boundary_violations = 0` means a rule you bothered to declare is one you actually keep.

## Deployment

- `cargo build --release` → static musl binaries via `.github/workflows/release.yml`, matrix: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` (with `SHA256SUMS`), `aarch64-apple-darwin`. `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh` downloads and checksum-verifies the right platform's build automatically when checkout is on a matching git tag — see [`docs/mcp-client-setup.md`](docs/mcp-client-setup.md) (Vietnamese).
- `Containerfile`, multi-stage (`rust:alpine` → `scratch`) — a single static binary, no runtime image needed, published to `ghcr.io/eilodon/code-intelligence` (tagged by version + `latest`) on every git tag push.
- `compose.yaml` ships a hardened example (`read_only`, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, `pids_limit: 64`, `mem_limit: 256m`).
- The repo uses Git LFS for `crates/ci-core/assets/potion-code-16m/*.safetensors` (~61MB) — run `git lfs install && git lfs pull` to get the real weight file. Without LFS, `git clone`/`cargo build` still **compiles successfully** (`include_bytes!` just embeds raw bytes without parsing them) — but that file is a ~130-byte LFS pointer instead of the real model, so loading it **at runtime** fails ("failed to parse safetensors"), `indexing_status` reports `embeddings_status: "failed"`, and `search(kind="semantic"/"hybrid")` automatically degrades to FTS-only — no crash, just no semantic search until you run `git lfs pull` and rebuild.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace                        # unit + integration (default features)
cargo test -p ci-core --features embeddings   # includes the semantic/vector path (brute-force cosine KNN)
cargo test --test parity_test test_formal_edges   # Stack Graphs regression corpus
```

Three CI jobs run on every PR: `verify` (fmt/clippy/test/audit), `stack-graphs-corpus` (formal-resolver parity), `embeddings` (clippy + test with the `embeddings` feature).

## Further reading

Resolver internals, ADRs, and migration plans live in [`docs/`](docs/) (mostly Vietnamese) — start with [`docs/comparison.md`](docs/comparison.md) for positioning or [`docs/architecture-design.md`](docs/architecture-design.md) for the technical design.
