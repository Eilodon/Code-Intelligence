CALM MCP tool workflow -- 8 stages, ~29 tools, `suggested_next` on every response tells you what to call next:
1. Orient -- repo_overview() ALWAYS first, then hotspots()/fitness_report() as needed.
2. Locate -- locate(query) (search+file_overview+symbol_info in 1 call) or search(query, kind=...).
3. Inspect -- source(symbol) for a symbol-precise read, or understand(symbol) for locate+source+callers together.
4. Trace -- callers(symbol), callees(symbol), path(from,to), dependencies(path).
5. Pre-Edit -- edit_context(symbol): MANDATORY before touching any symbol, no exceptions for real code (a Markdown/text heading is the one exception -- never carries a blast radius to check).
6. Edit -- edit_symbol(...)/edit_lines(...): CALM's own write path, hash-verified, risk-gated, reindexes immediately. Fall back to native Edit/Write only for a brand-new file or a path CALM doesn't index (dotdirs, target/, node_modules/, etc.).
7. Verify -- diff_impact(staged=true) MANDATORY before any commit/push -- no exceptions.
8. Recover -- session_context() after 10+ calls without progress; remember(topic, content)/recall(topic) for durable cross-session notes.
Only steps 5 and 7 are hard-enforced (a hook denies the native equivalent without them, under Claude Code); the rest is strongly recommended but not blocking.";
