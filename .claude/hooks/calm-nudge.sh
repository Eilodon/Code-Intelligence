# Project-scoped PreToolUse hook: nudge toward the "calm" (CALM — Coding
# Agent Liveness Map) MCP server's own tools instead of native Read/Grep/Edit/Bash, mirroring
# AGENTS.md's workflow stages. Additive alongside any user-level hooks
# (Claude Code concatenates hooks across settings scopes; it does not let
# a project hook suppress a user-level one).
#
# Two of AGENTS.md's rules are HARD-enforced here (permissionDecision: deny),
# not just nudged, tracked via a per-session state file:
#   - Stage 5: `edit_context` must be called at least once THIS SESSION FOR
#     EACH FILE before the first native `Edit` of that file (re-armed per
#     file, not once for the whole session — a session-wide unlock let an
#     agent review file A's blast radius then silently native-Edit file B,
#     never reviewed at all; see docs/superskills/specs/2026-07-13-calm-
#     agent-experience-upgrade.md). Still per-FILE, not per-symbol:
#     correlating each individual edit to a specific prior
#     edit_context(symbol) call isn't reliable from a shell hook, so this
#     enforces "checked blast radius before starting to edit this file",
#     not "checked it for every single edit". `edit_symbol`/`edit_lines`
#     are NOT gated this way — they carry their own per-call risk gate
#     (refuse a hub/high-caller touch without confirm:true), which is
#     stricter than this per-file heuristic, so gating them identically
#     would be redundant, not safer.
#   - Stage 7: `diff_impact` must be called after the most recent write
#     (native Edit/Write OR mcp__calm__edit_lines/edit_symbol) before a
#     `git commit`/`git push` — reset every time any of those four tools
#     writes, satisfied every time `diff_impact` runs, so this one IS
#     precise regardless of which write path was used.
# `Write` is deliberately NOT hard-gated: it also covers brand-new file
# creation, where no symbol exists yet for `edit_context` to look up —
# blocking it would deadlock. It keeps the pre-existing advisory nudge only.
#
# ADVISORY layer (2026-07-13 redesign, driven by an agent's own retro on why
# it drifted to native tools despite this hook — three levers, each aimed at
# a real friction rather than "nag harder"):
#   1. PRECISION over coverage. A nudge that fires on a *correct* native use
#      (grepping a .log, a piped `... | grep`, a dotdir CALM can't index)
#      teaches the agent to discount every nudge. So the advisory paths now
#      bail out on piped greps, unindexed targets, and — for the Stage-5
#      deny too — files under paths CALM never indexes (this script itself
#      lives under .claude/ and used to get falsely denied).
#   2. ACTIONABLE, not generic. Nudges interpolate the actual query/path so
#      the CALM alternative is copy-paste-ready — removing the "translate my
#      grep into a CALM call" step that made native feel cheaper.
#   3. A CHANGING NUMBER beats a fixed sentence. After the per-kind nudge cap,
#      instead of going fully silent (the blind spot where drift happens),
#      surface a running native-vs-CALM exploration tally every few calls and
#      at the commit checkpoint — a self-referential number resists the
#      habituation an identical reminder can't.

# --- 2026-07-14 "steepest hill" redesign: conditional enforcement for
# search/grep specifically ---
#
# A user-supplied analysis (grounded in MCP-Bench data + a documented Claude
# Code community report that even Anthropic's OWN Grep/Read native tools get
# bypassed for raw Bash `cat`/`grep` without a blocking hook) argued that
# search/grep is the single steepest hill to nudge, for three compounding
# reasons: (1) "type a query -> reach for grep" is a pretraining-level
# reflex, reinforced a SECOND time by Claude Code's own system prompt
# training a model to prefer ITS OWN native Grep/Read over raw Bash --
# meaning an MCP tool has to out-compete two stacked habits, not one, unlike
# Edit/Write which face only the second; (2) search/grep fires 10-40x more
# often per session than edit/write (MCP-Bench: ~20-80 tool calls/task), so
# even an IDENTICAL per-call compliance rate produces a visibly worse
# aggregate ratio purely from volume; (3) a mutating action gets more model
# "caution" (slow down, re-read guidance) than a read-only one, which gets
# processed as a cheap reflexive action.
#
# The actionable recommendation, and the one implemented below: don't treat
# compliance as one blob. Nudge (or, if ever hardened, deny) ONLY the case
# CALM actually wins clearly -- multi-file/repo-wide scope, or a
# symbol/identifier-shaped query even when scoped to one file (locate
# returns definition+callers+type, strictly more than a text match). Stay
# SILENT for a single-file grep with a real regex/free-text pattern --
# ripgrep genuinely has no CALM equivalent there, and nudging it anyway is
# exactly the false-positive class this file's header (lever #1) already
# identifies as corrosive to every OTHER, genuinely-useful nudge. This also
# directly serves the frequency-effect problem above: fewer, better-targeted
# nudges land more of NUDGE_CAP's two "full message" shows on cases that
# actually matter, instead of burning them on trivial single-file lookups.

# True when `pat` looks like a plain identifier (a symbol/function/class
# name) rather than a real regex or free-text phrase -- mcp__calm__locate
# gives strictly more (definition + callers + type) than a text match for
# exactly this query shape, regardless of file scope, so it's worth nudging
# even when grep_path names one specific file.

# (same tolerance as is_real_git_commit_or_push above): any `-r`/`-R`/

# 2026-07-14 backlog B2: NUDGE_CAP was counting *how many times shown* as a
# proxy for "lesson learned", then going FULLY AND PERMANENTLY silent past
# it — including no longer incrementing nudge_counts, so the count itself
# froze at NUDGE_CAP forever and there was no way to tell "shown twice, never
# happened again" apart from "shown twice, then happened 50 more times
# silently". Fixed the same way nudge_or_tally already handles this for
# native-explore: keep counting past the cap, and resurface every
# TALLY_EVERY-th occurrence with the actual count instead of staying silent
# forever. Deliberately NOT auto-escalating to a deny here (that would skip
# the shadow-mode measurement step already agreed for Read/Grep in Part A of
# the backlog doc) — this only ever changes message cadence, never

# provable-safe justification, not just "not real code". Proven against
# crates/calm-core/src/graph/hub.rs::update_is_hub_flags: its hub query
# source is `WHERE caller_count >= 1 OR coreness > 0`, and a Markdown
# heading symbol (`kind='heading'`, see
# crates/calm-core/src/indexer/parser.rs's markdown extraction) never gets a
# call-graph edge, so caller_count/coreness are always 0 -- is_hub is
# provably always false for prose. That proof does NOT extend to
# .yml/.json/.toml/.lock: a broken CI workflow YAML or a broken Cargo.lock
# has real operational blast radius CALM's call graph simply doesn't model,
# which is a different risk shape from "a doc heading nobody calls" --

# --- PostToolUse: just-in-time nudge grounded in the REAL result of a Bash

# "steepest hill" redesign — docs/plans/2026-07-14-search-grep-steepest-hill-followups.md,
# "PostToolUse just-in-time nudge"). Built only after capturing and reading a
# REAL payload from this exact repo/hook (.calm/.hook-state/posttooluse-grep-dump.jsonl,
# via the still-wired posttooluse-discovery-dump.sh), not against the official
# docs example alone — that example shows Bash's tool_response as a plain
# string, but the real captured payload here is a structured object:
# {stdout, stderr, interrupted, isImage, noOutputExpected,
# [returnCodeInterpretation]}. Confirmed live: (a) PostToolUse fires
# regardless of grep's own exit code (0 or 1) as long as the Bash tool call
# itself doesn't error; (b) `returnCodeInterpretation: "No matches found"`
# appears on at least some zero-match cases — a free, pre-labeled signal,
# used here with an empty-stdout fallback for when it's absent; (c) explicit
# `--color=always` leaks raw ANSI straight into stdout with no equivalent of
# the native Grep tool's per-match `ansi_codes` flag — stripped defensively
# below even though grep's own default (--color=auto) never colorizes into a
# non-tty pipe in practice.
#
# The native `Grep` tool's own tool_response.matches[] schema (structured:
# path/line_number/line_text/ansi_codes) is doc-derived only
# (code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) and was NOT live-verified — this harness has
# no native Grep tool to call. So this function deliberately handles ONLY the
# Bash path; a real Grep-tool PostToolUse event still just falls through to
# posttooluse-discovery-dump.sh (still wired in settings.json) until a real
# payload from an environment that has the tool confirms its shape too.
