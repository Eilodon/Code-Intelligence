// Thin exec wrapper — the real work is the Rust `calm` binary shipped by one
// of the platform packages below (@eilodon/calm-mcp-<platform>), selected via
// optionalDependencies + npm's os/cpu matching at install time. This file
// only resolves which one landed in node_modules and runs it, forwarding
// argv and stdio untouched (MCP talks JSON-RPC over stdio — nothing here
// may write to stdout).
//
// Uses `spawn` (async) plus explicit signal forwarding, not `spawnSync`:
// `spawnSync(..., {stdio: 'inherit'})` blocks this process until the child
// exits, but does NOT tie the child's lifetime to this process's — if an MCP
// client kills only this Node PID (SIGTERM is `ChildProcess.kill()`'s
// default, and what most editors/process managers send), the `calm` child
// never sees that signal and is orphaned: it keeps running, keeps its DB
// connection and possibly the indexer lock, and is a real contributor to
// unbounded WAL growth (SQLite's auto-checkpoint is starved by any
// connection still holding an old snapshot open). Forwarding the signal here
// lets the same graceful-shutdown path a directly-run `calm` binary gets
// (SIGINT/SIGTERM handling in calm-server, including a WAL checkpoint on the
// way out) actually run instead of leaving an orphan behind.
