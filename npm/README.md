# Publishing `@eilodon/ci-mcp` to npm

This directory scaffolds an npm distribution for `ci` alongside the existing
`scripts/install.sh` and git-clone-based `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh` paths —
see [`../docs/mcp-client-setup.md`](../docs/mcp-client-setup.md) for how all
three compare. It follows the same split every other Rust-CLI-on-npm project
uses (esbuild, swc, ripgrep wrappers): a thin JS entrypoint package
(`ci-mcp/`) plus one binary-only package per platform
(`ci-mcp-<platform>/`), wired together with `optionalDependencies` so `npm`
installs only the one matching binary for whoever's running it — no
postinstall network fetch, no arbitrary script execution.

**Nothing here is published automatically yet** — this is intentionally a
manual first publish (see the memory note this was scoped from) so the
package name/scope gets a human sanity check against the real registry
before any CI automation is wired to it.

## One-time setup (before the very first publish)

1. Create/sign in to an npm account that's a member of, or can create, the
   `@eilodon` org scope (`npm org` or the npm website). Scoped packages
   default to private, hence `--access public` below.
2. `npm login` locally.

## Publishing a release

Run this **after** `.github/workflows/release.yml` has finished publishing
the GitHub Release for a tag (stage-release.sh downloads from it, so the
release must already exist):

```bash
npm/stage-release.sh v0.2.0     # downloads all 3 platform binaries + bumps
                                 # every package.json under npm/ to 0.2.0
```

Then publish in this order — platform packages first, so a consumer who
installs the wrapper right after can already resolve its
`optionalDependencies`:

```bash
cd npm/ci-mcp-linux-x64    && npm publish --access public && cd -
cd npm/ci-mcp-linux-arm64  && npm publish --access public && cd -
cd npm/ci-mcp-darwin-arm64 && npm publish --access public && cd -
cd npm/ci-mcp              && npm publish --access public && cd -
```

## Verifying before you publish for real

`npm/stage-release.sh` only downloads and stages — it never calls `npm
publish`. Before your first real publish, sanity-check the staged package
locally:

```bash
npm/stage-release.sh v0.1.0   # or whatever tag is current
cd npm/ci-mcp && npm pack --dry-run   # shows exactly what `files` would ship
node bin/ci-mcp.js --version          # only works once a platform package's
                                       # `ci` binary is resolvable — e.g. via
                                       # `npm link` from ci-mcp-<platform>/,
                                       # or a manual node_modules symlink
```

## Once this is stable: adding CI automation

If/when the manual flow above has been run at least once successfully, the
natural next step is a `release.yml` job that runs `stage-release.sh` +
`npm publish` automatically, gated on an `NPM_TOKEN` repo secret — deferred
for now by deliberate choice, not an oversight; see the `oss-launch-distribution`
project memory for why.
