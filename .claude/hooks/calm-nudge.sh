# Project-scoped PreToolUse hook: nudge toward the "calm" (CALM — Coding
# Agent Liveness Map) MCP server's own tools instead of native Read/Grep/Edit/Bash, mirroring
# AGENTS.md's workflow stages. Additive alongside any user-level hooks
# (Claude Code concatenates hooks across settings scopes; it does not let
# a project hook suppress a user-level one).
#
# Two of AGENTS.md's rules are HARD-enforced here (permissionDecision: deny),
# not just nudged, tracked via a per-session state file:
#   - Stage 5: `edit_context` must be called at least once THIS SESSION FOR
#     EACH FILE before the first native `Edit` of that file (re-armed per
#     file, not once for the whole session — a session-wide unlock let an
#     agent review file A's blast radius then silently native-Edit file B,
#     never reviewed at all; see docs/superskills/specs/2026-07-13-calm-
#     agent-experience-upgrade.md). Still per-FILE, not per-symbol:
#     correlating each individual edit to a specific prior
#     edit_context(symbol) call isn't reliable from a shell hook, so this
#     enforces "checked blast radius before starting to edit this file",
#     not "checked it for every single edit". `edit_symbol`/`edit_lines`
#     are NOT gated this way — they carry their own per-call risk gate
#     (refuse a hub/high-caller touch without confirm:true), which is
#     stricter than this per-file heuristic, so gating them identically
#     would be redundant, not safer.
#   - Stage 7: `diff_impact` must be called after the most recent write
#     (native Edit/Write OR mcp__calm__edit_lines/edit_symbol) before a
#     `git commit`/`git push` — reset every time any of those four tools
#     writes, satisfied every time `diff_impact` runs, so this one IS
#     precise regardless of which write path was used.
# `Write` is deliberately NOT hard-gated: it also covers brand-new file
# creation, where no symbol exists yet for `edit_context` to look up —
# blocking it would deadlock. It keeps the pre-existing advisory nudge only.
#
# ADVISORY layer (2026-07-13 redesign, driven by an agent's own retro on why
# it drifted to native tools despite this hook — three levers, each aimed at
# a real friction rather than "nag harder"):
#   1. PRECISION over coverage. A nudge that fires on a *correct* native use
#      (grepping a .log, a piped `... | grep`, a dotdir CALM can't index)
#      teaches the agent to discount every nudge. So the advisory paths now
#      bail out on piped greps, unindexed targets, and — for the Stage-5
#      deny too — files under paths CALM never indexes (this script itself
#      lives under .claude/ and used to get falsely denied).
#   2. ACTIONABLE, not generic. Nudges interpolate the actual query/path so
#      the CALM alternative is copy-paste-ready — removing the "translate my
#      grep into a CALM call" step that made native feel cheaper.
#   3. A CHANGING NUMBER beats a fixed sentence. After the per-kind nudge cap,
#      instead of going fully silent (the blind spot where drift happens),
#      surface a running native-vs-CALM exploration tally every few calls and
#      at the commit checkpoint — a self-referential number resists the
#      habituation an identical reminder can't.
