# Project-scoped PreToolUse hook: nudge toward the "ci" (Code Intelligence)
# MCP server's own tools instead of native Read/Grep/Edit/Bash, mirroring
# AGENTS.md's workflow stages. Additive alongside any user-level hooks
# (Claude Code concatenates hooks across settings scopes; it does not let
# a project hook suppress a user-level one).
#
# Two of AGENTS.md's rules are HARD-enforced here (permissionDecision: deny),
# not just nudged, tracked via a per-session state file:
#   - Stage 5: `edit_context` must be called at least once this session
#     before the first `Edit` of a source-code file (never re-blocked after
#     that — correlating each individual edit to a specific prior
#     edit_context(symbol) call isn't reliable from a shell hook, so this
#     enforces "checked blast radius before starting to edit", not
#     "checked it for every single edit").
#   - Stage 7: `diff_impact` must be called after the most recent Edit/Write
#     before a `git commit`/`git push` — reset every time a file changes,
#     satisfied every time `diff_impact` runs, so this one IS precise.
# `Write` is deliberately NOT hard-gated: it also covers brand-new file
# creation, where no symbol exists yet for `edit_context` to look up —
# blocking it would deadlock. It keeps the pre-existing advisory nudge only.

# pinned to the project root regardless of any `cd` inside `cmd` (this
# harness resets the shell's cwd between Bash calls), so neither `pwd` nor
# the hook JSON's `cwd` field can distinguish this — the command text itself
# is the only signal available. Best-effort, not a real shell parser: honors
