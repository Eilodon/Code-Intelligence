//! Data-driven description of one SCIP-capable language, so adding a new
//! provider (Go, Java, ...) means adding one `ScipProvider` value instead of
//! copying this whole `scip/` module — see the plan doc
//! `docs/superskills/plans/2026-07-07-eight-lang-formal-tier.md` §3 (P0.4).
//!
//! 8 entries exist today: `RUST`, `GO` (P2.1), `PYTHON` (P2.4), `TYPESCRIPT`
//! (P3.2, covers JS+TS), `JAVA` (P2.2), `CSHARP` (P2.3), `PHP` (P2.5), and
//! `CLANG` (P3.1, scaffold-only — see its own doc comment). Fields sketched
//! in the plan's P0.4 design for multi-root marker-file discovery, prereq
//! gating, and refresh policy are still deliberately NOT here — none of the
//! single-project cases needed them yet (Go's `go.work` multi-module
//! handling is a documented upstream `scip-go` limitation, not something
//! this table papers over yet; scip-python/scip-typescript each index one
//! `--cwd` tree per invocation). Add them when a provider actually needs
//! them.
//!
//! **Live-verification history is uneven across these 8 — "the code exists"
//! and "confirmed working right now" are two different claims, don't conflate
//! them** (audited 2026-07-10). `GO`, `JAVA`, `CSHARP`, and `PHP` were each
//! manually verified live-passing exactly once, by the session that
//! implemented them, against a real indexer binary with a real toolchain
//! (see `docs/superskills/plans/2026-07-07-eight-lang-formal-tier.md` §5's
//! table for the exact fixture results and match rates — e.g. Go 0.67,
//! Java 1.00). None of that has been *continuously* re-verified since,
//! though: `RUST` is the only provider with a real green run in GitHub
//! Actions CI history (`.github/workflows/scip-nightly.yml`, run
//! 2026-07-08) — every nightly run new enough to include the other
//! providers either predates the relevant commit or failed before reaching
//! the test step. `PHP`'s own `scip-php` install is currently, actively
//! broken in CI as of that audit: Composer refuses `davidrjenni/scip-php`
//! because its `google/protobuf` dependency range is blocked by security
//! advisory PKSA-tcfz-w4fm-hhk9 (see the pinned-version workaround in
//! `scip-nightly.yml`). `PYTHON` and `TYPESCRIPT` were independently
//! re-confirmed live-passing by hand in a plain dev sandbox during the same
//! 2026-07-10 audit (both run through `npx` with no extra toolchain install,
//! so friction — and therefore real-world reach — is far lower than
//! Go/Java/C#/PHP, which all need a locally installed toolchain). `CLANG`
//! has no live-verification path at all, ever, by design — see its own doc
//! comment below for the two independent blockers.
