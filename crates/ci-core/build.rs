//! Stamps the git commit this binary was built from into `CI_BUILD_INFO`
//! (read via `env!()` in `src/lib.rs` as `ci_core::BUILD_INFO`), so `ci
//! doctor`/`ci --version` can report "what commit am I actually running",
//! not just the Cargo.toml version string (which doesn't change per-commit).
//! Root cause this exists for: a stale `target/debug/ci` binary silently
//! served an entire MCP session because nothing surfaced that it predated
//! the checked-out source — see `scripts/mcp-launcher.sh`'s freshness check
//! for the other half of the fix.
//!
//! No `cargo:rerun-if-changed` directives are emitted deliberately: with
//! none emitted, Cargo's default is "rerun if anything in this package
//! changed", which already recompiles whenever a change would plausibly
//! trigger a rebuild anyway — narrowing this to just `.git/HEAD` would miss
//! workspace-wide dependency changes and untracked/unstaged edits (the
//! exact kind of drift this is meant to catch).
//!
//! Best-effort: falls back to `"unknown"` if git isn't available or this
//! isn't a git checkout (e.g. a source tarball) — never fails the build.
