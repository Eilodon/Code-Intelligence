# SessionStart hook: best-effort pre-build of the calm-cli binary.
#
# CORRECTION (2026-07-02): the previous version of this comment claimed a
# synchronous build here "fixes it for the rest of the session" — that is
# false, confirmed against code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp and
# .../claude-code-on-the-web. SessionStart hooks and MCP server connection
# attempts are NOT ordered: MCP startup is "non-blocking by default" and
# dials configured servers concurrently with hooks, not after them. A cold
# `cargo build -p calm-cli` (~59s measured: tree-sitter grammars + stack-graphs
# + bundled SQLite) can easily still be running when the "calm" server's
# initial connection attempt times out — which gets at most 3 quick retries
# (~7s total backoff, v2.1.121+) before Claude Code marks the server failed
# for the rest of the session, with no further retry. This hook can *win*
# that race, but cannot *guarantee* winning it — see
# docs/cloud-environment-setup.md for why the real fix is a Cloud
# environment Setup Script (runs once, before Claude Code launches at all,
# cached across sessions), not anything that runs from SessionStart.
#
# This hook is still worth keeping for two reasons: (1) it's the only
# mechanism available for local/non-cloud Claude Code, where there is no
# environment Setup Script concept at all; (2) unlike
# `mcp-launcher.sh` (.mcp.json's actual entrypoint as of 2026-07-12, after
# retiring the `calm-mcp-wrapper.sh` indirection layer — see its own
# freshness-checked target/release -> target/debug -> download -> build
# fallback), this always runs `cargo build`, so it also catches the binary
# being *stale* — e.g. mid-session edits to calm's own source in a prior
# session. Kept synchronous so that when it does win the race, the win is
# real (no async handoff for the MCP dial to slip past).

# Resolve any unresolved Git LFS pointer stubs (assets/potion-code-16m/* —
# the vendored embedding model; this used to also cover .calm-bin/**/calm,
# retired 2026-07-12 in favor of a GitHub Release download — see
# mcp-launcher.sh's tier 1.5) BEFORE building. Real
# incident this guards against: a checkout without git-lfs installed leaves
# ~130-byte pointer text in place of real file content; `cargo build` still
# succeeds (it just bakes that pointer text into the binary via
# `include_bytes!`), and the failure only surfaces later, silently, as
# `embeddings_status: "failed"` at runtime — not a build error, so nothing
# here would have caught it otherwise. Every step is best-effort and
# non-fatal (`|| true`) — this hook must degrade, not break the session, and
# `Embedder::load`'s own runtime fallback (network download) plus
# `embeddings_status: "offline_unavailable"` messaging are the safety net if
# this doesn't fully resolve it (e.g. no apt, no network, git-lfs install
# blocked). See docs/cloud-environment-setup.md for the full picture.

# Best-effort, NON-blocking self-heal for target/release/calm (the actual
# .mcp.json entrypoint's fast path, via mcp-launcher.sh directly since
# 2026-07-12). Only fires when release is missing or older than the
# debug build just confirmed fresh above — i.e. genuinely stale, not on
# every session. Never awaited: a release build measured ~9min in this repo
# (vs. ~59s for debug) would blow this hook's own 300s timeout on nearly
# every run if done synchronously, defeating the whole "win the race"
# purpose above. mkdir is atomic, so N sessions starting around the same
# time queue at most one rebuild rather than N redundant ones (cargo itself
# also serializes concurrent builds against the same target dir, but the
# lock avoids piling up N sleeping cargo processes doing nothing).
#
# Real incident this guards against (2026-07-12): a manual
# `cargo clean -p calm-server` removed target/release/calm entirely, and
# nothing rebuilt it afterward — the old calm-mcp-wrapper.sh's hardcoded
# `exec` had no fallback, so every new MCP session failed outright until
# someone noticed and ran `cargo build --release` by hand.
# `mcp-launcher.sh` (now .mcp.json's direct entrypoint, the wrapper having
# been retired as redundant indirection) falls back to target/debug/calm
# when release is missing, so a session is never fully broken by this
# again — but without this block, it would stay on the slower debug binary
# forever instead of self-healing back to release.
