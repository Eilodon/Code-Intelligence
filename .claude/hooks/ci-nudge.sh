# Project-scoped PreToolUse hook: nudge toward the "ci" (Code Intelligence)
# MCP server's own tools instead of native Read/Grep/Edit/Bash, mirroring
# AGENTS.md's workflow stages. Additive alongside any user-level hooks
# (Claude Code concatenates hooks across settings scopes; it does not let
# a project hook suppress a user-level one).
#
# Two of AGENTS.md's rules are HARD-enforced here (permissionDecision: deny),
# not just nudged, tracked via a per-session state file:
#   - Stage 5: `edit_context` must be called at least once this session
#     before the first native `Edit` of a source-code file (never re-blocked
#     after that — correlating each individual edit to a specific prior
#     edit_context(symbol) call isn't reliable from a shell hook, so this
#     enforces "checked blast radius before starting to edit", not "checked
#     it for every single edit"). `edit_symbol`/`edit_lines` are NOT gated
#     this way — they carry their own per-call risk gate (refuse a
#     hub/high-caller touch without confirm:true), which is stricter than
#     this session-level heuristic, so gating them identically would be
#     redundant, not safer.
#   - Stage 7: `diff_impact` must be called after the most recent write
#     (native Edit/Write OR mcp__ci__edit_lines/edit_symbol) before a
#     `git commit`/`git push` — reset every time any of those four tools
#     writes, satisfied every time `diff_impact` runs, so this one IS
#     precise regardless of which write path was used.
# `Write` is deliberately NOT hard-gated: it also covers brand-new file
# creation, where no symbol exists yet for `edit_context` to look up —
# blocking it would deadlock. It keeps the pre-existing advisory nudge only.

# Max times to show the *same* nudge (by key) within one session. LLM agents

# the agent has a deliberate reason to keep choosing the native tool (trust
# it, per AGENTS.md's "override only when you have explicit context the
# hint cannot account for"), or repeating it further isn't going to help.
